<h1>Third party licenses</h1>
<hr>
This game is built on the Godot Engine (https://godotengine.org/), version 3.2.3, using Godot's Mono integration. We use official builds and export templates which are available at https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/3.2.3/mono/<br><br>
Source code for Godot is available at https://github.com/godotengine/godot, and source code for Mono is available at https://github.com/mono/mono.<br><br>
Please note that we are only students, not lawyers - we have tried our best to locate and reference third party/open source code below.<br><br>

Godot uses various pieces of third party open source components - you can find a list of these below, along with copyright statements and license information.<br>

 Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License

 By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
 to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
 Attribution 4.0 International Public License (&quot;Public
 License&quot;). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a
 contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your
 acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You
 such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from
 making the Licensed Material available under these terms and
 conditions.

 Section 1 -- Definitions.

 a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
 Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
 and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
 arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
 permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
 Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
 Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,
 Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
 synched in timed relation with a moving image.

 b. Adapter&#x27;s License means the license You apply to Your Copyright
 and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
 accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.

 c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
 closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
 performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
 Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
 categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
 specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
 Rights.

 d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
 absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
 fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
 Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
 agreements.

 e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
 any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
 that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

 f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
 or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
 License.

 g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
 terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
 all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
 Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.

 h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
 under this Public License.

 i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
 process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
 as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
 dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
 available to the public including in ways that members of the
 public may access the material from a place and at a time
 individually chosen by them.

 j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
 resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
 the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
 as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
 equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

 k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
 under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.

 Section 2 -- Scope.

 a. License grant.

 1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
 the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
 non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
 exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

 a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
 in part; and

 b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

 2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
 Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
 License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
 its terms and conditions.

 3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
 6(a).

 4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
 Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
 all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
 and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
 Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
 authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
 necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
 technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
 Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
 simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
 (4) never produces Adapted Material.

 5. Downstream recipients.

 a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
 recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
 receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
 Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
 Public License.

 b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
 any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
 apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
 Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
 Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
 Material.

 6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
 may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
 are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
 with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
 the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
 provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

 b. Other rights.

 1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
 licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
 privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
 the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
 assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
 extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
 Rights, but not otherwise.

 2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
 Public License.

 3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
 collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
 Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
 under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
 licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
 reserves any right to collect such royalties.

 Section 3 -- License Conditions.

 Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
 following conditions.

 a. Attribution.

 1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
 form), You must:

 a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
 with the Licensed Material:

 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
 Material and any others designated to receive
 attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
 the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
 designated);

 ii. a copyright notice;

 iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

 iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
 warranties;

 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
 extent reasonably practicable;

 b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
 retain an indication of any previous modifications; and

 c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
 Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
 hyperlink to, this Public License.

 2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
 reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
 which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
 reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
 hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
 information.

 3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
 information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
 reasonably practicable.

 4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter&#x27;s
 License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
 Material from complying with this Public License.

 Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

 Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
 apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

 a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
 to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
 portion of the contents of the database;

 b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
 contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
 Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
 Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and

 c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
 all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

 For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
 replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
 Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.

 Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

 a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
 EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
 AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
 ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
 IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
 WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
 PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
 ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
 KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
 ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

 b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
 TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
 NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
 INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
 COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
 USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
 ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
 DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
 IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

 c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
 above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
 possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
 waiver of all liability.

 Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

 a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
 Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
 this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
 terminate automatically.

 b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
 Section 6(a), it reinstates:

 1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
 it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
 violation; or

 2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

 For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
 right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
 of this Public License.

 c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
 Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
 distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
 will not terminate this Public License.

 d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
 License.

 Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.

 a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
 terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

 b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
 Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
 independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.

 Section 8 -- Interpretation.

 a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
 shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
 conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
 be made without permission under this Public License.

 b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
 deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
 minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
 cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
 without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
 conditions.

 c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
 failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
 Licensor.

 d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
 as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
 that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
 processes of any jurisdiction or authority.</li>

 2. License Grants and Conditions
 --------------------------------

 2.1. Grants

 Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
 non-exclusive license:

 (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
     Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
     modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
     Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
     as part of a Larger Work; and

 (b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
     for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
     Contributions or its Contributor Version.

 2.2. Effective Date

 The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
 become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
 distributes such Contribution.

 2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

 The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
 this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
 distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
 Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
 Contributor:

 (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
     or

 (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party&#x27;s
     modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
     Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
     Version); or

 (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
     its Contributions.

 This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
 or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
 the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

 2.4. Subsequent Licenses

 No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
 distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
 License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
 permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

 2.5. Representation

 Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
 Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
 to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

 2.6. Fair Use

 This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
 applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
 equivalents.

 2.7. Conditions

 Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
 in Section 2.1.

 3. Responsibilities
 -------------------

 3.1. Distribution of Source Form

 All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
 Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
 the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
 Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
 License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
 attempt to alter or restrict the recipients&#x27; rights in the Source Code
 Form.

 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

 If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

 (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
     Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
     the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
     Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
     than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

 (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
     License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
     license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
     the recipients&#x27; rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

 You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
 provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
 the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
 Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
 Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
 License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
 under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
 the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
 Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
 License(s).

 3.4. Notices

 You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
 (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
 or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
 the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
 the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

 3.5. Application of Additional Terms

 You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
 indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
 Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
 behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
 such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
 You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
 liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
 indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
 disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
 jurisdiction.

 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
 ---------------------------------------------------

 If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
 License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
 statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
 the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
 describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
 be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
 Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
 or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
 recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

 5. Termination
 --------------

 5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
 if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
 compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
 Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
 Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
 ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
 non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
 come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
 Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
 notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
 first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
 from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
 Your receipt of the notice.

 5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
 infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
 counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
 directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
 You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
 2.1 of this License shall terminate.

 5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
 end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
 have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
 prior to termination shall survive termination.

 *  Covered Software is provided under this License on an &quot;as is&quot;       *
 *  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or  *
 *  statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the       *
 *  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *
 *  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the     *
 *  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        *
 *  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You     *
 *  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *
 *  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *
 *  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is   *
 *  authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.         *
 *                                                                      *

 *  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    *

 *  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *
 *  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and          *

 *                                                                      *
 ************************************************************************

 8. Litigation
 -------------

 Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
 courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
 place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
 jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
 Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party&#x27;s ability to bring
 cross-claims or counter-claims.

 9. Miscellaneous
 ----------------

 This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
 matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
 unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
 necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
 that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
 shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

 10. Versions of the License
 ---------------------------

 10.1. New Versions

 Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
 publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
 distinguishing version number.

 10.2. Effect of New Versions

 You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
 of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
 or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
 steward.

 10.3. Modified Versions

 If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
 create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
 modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
 any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
 such modified license differs from this License).

 10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
 Licenses

 If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
 Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
 notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

 PREAMBLE
 The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
 development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
 efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
 open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
 with others.

 The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
 redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
 fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
 redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
 names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
 however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
 requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
 to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

 DEFINITIONS
 &quot;Font Software&quot; refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
 Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
 include source files, build scripts and documentation.

 &quot;Reserved Font Name&quot; refers to any names specified as such after the
 copyright statement(s).

 &quot;Original Version&quot; refers to the collection of Font Software components as
 distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

 &quot;Modified Version&quot; refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
 or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
 Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
 new environment.

 &quot;Author&quot; refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
 writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

 PERMISSION &amp; CONDITIONS
 Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
 a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
 redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
 Software, subject to the following conditions:

 in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

 2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
 redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
 contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
 included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
 in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
 binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

 3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font

 Introduction
 ============

 The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
 some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
 various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
 FreeType Project.

 This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
 which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
 affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
 documentation and makefiles, at the very least.

 This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
 (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
 and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
 alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:

   o We don&#x27;t promise that this software works. However, we will be
     interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is&#x27; distribution)

   o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
     full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free&#x27; usage)

   o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
     it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
     somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
     FreeType code. (`credits&#x27;)

 We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
 software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
 We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
 assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.

 .
 Legal Terms
 ===========

 0. Definitions
 --------------

 Throughout this license,  the terms `package&#x27;, `FreeType Project&#x27;,
 and  `FreeType  archive&#x27; refer  to  the  set  of files  originally
 distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and
 Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project&#x27;, be they named as alpha,
 beta or final release.

 `You&#x27; refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
 `using&#x27; is a generic term including compiling the project&#x27;s source
 code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program&#x27; or `executable&#x27;.
 This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType
 engine&#x27;.

 This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
 FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and
 documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
 original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
 If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
 this license, you must contact us to verify this.

 The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,
 Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as
 specified below.

 1. No Warranty
 --------------

 THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS&#x27; WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY
 KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,
 WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR
 PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
 BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO
 USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.

 2. Redistribution
 -----------------

 This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and
 irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,
 display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and
 sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code
 forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to
 authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted
 herein, subject to the following conditions:

   o Redistribution  of source code  must retain this  license file
     (`LICENSE.TXT&#x27;) unaltered; any additions, deletions or changes
     to   the  original   files  must   be  clearly   indicated  in
     accompanying  documentation.   The  copyright notices  of  the
     unaltered, original  files must be preserved in  all copies of
     source files.

   o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that
     states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the
     FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also
     encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your
     documentation, though this isn&#x27;t mandatory.

 These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on
 the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use
 our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid
 to us.

 3. Advertising
 --------------

 Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use
 the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional
 purposes without specific prior written permission.

 We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the
 following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation
 or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project&#x27;,  `FreeType Engine&#x27;,
 `FreeType library&#x27;, or `FreeType Distribution&#x27;.

 As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to
 accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted
 material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the
 authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.
 Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType
 Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms
 of this license.

 4. Contacts

 CC0 1.0 Universal

 Statement of Purpose

 The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
 exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
 subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an &quot;owner&quot;) of an original work of
 authorship and/or a database (each, a &quot;Work&quot;).

 Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
 purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific
 works (&quot;Commons&quot;) that the public can reliably and without fear of later
 claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse
 and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any
 purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may
 contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the
 further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain
 reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and
 efforts of others.

 For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation
 of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
 Work (the &quot;Affirmer&quot;), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
 and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work
 and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
 Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
 effect of CC0 on those rights.

 1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
 protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (&quot;Copyright and
 Related Rights&quot;). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
 to, the following:

 i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
 and translate a Work;

 ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);

 iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person&#x27;s image or likeness
 depicted in a Work;

 iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
 subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;

 v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
 a Work;

 vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
 European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
 protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
 including any amended or successor version of such directive); and

 vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
 based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.

 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
 applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
 unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer&#x27;s Copyright
 and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
 known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
 action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
 duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
 extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
 copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
 commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the &quot;Waiver&quot;). Affirmer makes
 the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the
 detriment of Affirmer&#x27;s heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver
 shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or
 any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work
 by the public as contemplated by Affirmer&#x27;s express Statement of Purpose.

 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
 judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
 shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
 Affirmer&#x27;s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver
 is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,
 non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and
 unconditional license to exercise Affirmer&#x27;s Copyright and Related Rights in
 the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration
 provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
 in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
 purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or
 promotional purposes (the &quot;License&quot;). The License shall be deemed effective as
 of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the
 License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under
 applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not
 invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby
 affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining
 Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims
 and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to
 Affirmer&#x27;s express Statement of Purpose.

 4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

 a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
 surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.

 b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
 of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,
 including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
 for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or
 other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not
 discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.

 c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
 that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation
 any person&#x27;s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer
 disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions
 or other rights required for any use of the Work.

 d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
 party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
 CC0 or use of the Work.</li>

          trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce,

          modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original

          Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, and/or

          as part of a Larger Work; and



          (b) under Patents Claims infringed by the making, using or

          selling of Original Code, to make, have made, use, practice,

          sell, and offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the

          Original Code (or portions thereof).



          (c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are

          effective on the date Initial Developer first distributes

          Original Code under the terms of this License.



          (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is

          granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2)

          separate from the Original Code;  or 3) for infringements caused

          by: i) the modification of the Original Code or ii) the

          combination of the Original Code with other software or devices.



     2.2. Contributor Grant.

     Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor

     hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license



          (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or

          unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code

          and/or as part of a Larger Work; and



          (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or

          selling of  Modifications made by that Contributor either alone

          and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions

          of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have

          made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that

          Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of

          Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor

          Version (or portions of such combination).



          (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are

          effective on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of

          the Covered Code.



          (d)    Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is

          granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the

          Contributor Version; 2)  separate from the Contributor Version;

          3)  for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of

          Contributor Version or ii)  the combination of Modifications made

          by that Contributor with other software  (except as part of the

          Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims

          infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by

          that Contributor.



3. Distribution Obligations.



     3.1. Application of License.

     The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are

     governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation

     Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be

     distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version

     of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a

     copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You

     distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code

     version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this

     License or the recipients&#x27; rights hereunder. However, You may include

     an additional document offering the additional rights described in

     Section 3.5.



     3.2. Availability of Source Code.

     Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be

     made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License

     either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted

     Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an

     Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic

     Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)

     months after the date it initially became available, or at least six

     (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification

     has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for

     ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the

     Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.



     3.3. Description of Modifications.

     You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a

     file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and

     the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that

     the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original

     Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the

     Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an

     Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the

     origin or ownership of the Covered Code.



     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters

          (a) Third Party Claims.

          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party&#x27;s

          intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights

          granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,

          Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code

          distribution titled &quot;LEGAL&quot; which describes the claim and the

          party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will

          know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after

          the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,

          Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies

          Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps

          (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)

          reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered

          Code that new knowledge has been obtained.



          (b) Contributor APIs.

          If Contributor&#x27;s Modifications include an application programming

          interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which

          are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must

          also include this information in the LEGAL file.



               (c)    Representations.

          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to

          Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor&#x27;s

          Modifications are Contributor&#x27;s original creation(s) and/or

          Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by

          this License.



     3.5. Required Notices.

     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source

     Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source

     Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a

     location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely

     to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)

     You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in

     Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation

     for the Source Code where You describe recipients&#x27; rights or ownership

     rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to

     charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability

     obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You

     may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial

     Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than

     any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is

     offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial

     Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the

     Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,

     support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.



     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.

     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the

     requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,

     and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of

     the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,

     including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the

     obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included

     in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or

     collateral in which You describe recipients&#x27; rights relating to the

     Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered

     Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may

     contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in

     compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the

     Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient&#x27;s

     rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this

     License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different

     license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ

     from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial

     Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the

     Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by

     the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such

     terms You offer.



     3.7. Larger Works.

     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code

     not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger

     Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the

     requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.



4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.



     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this

     License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to

     statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with

     the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)

     describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description

     must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must

     be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the

     extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be

     sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to

     understand it.



5. Application of this License.



     This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has

     attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.



6. Versions of the License.



     6.1. New Versions.

     Netscape Communications Corporation (&quot;Netscape&quot;) may publish revised

     and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version

     will be given a distinguishing version number.



     6.2. Effect of New Versions.

     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the

     License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that

     version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms

     of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one

     other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to

     Covered Code created under this License.



     6.3. Derivative Works.

     If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may

     only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code

     governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that

     the phrases &quot;Mozilla&quot;, &quot;MOZILLAPL&quot;, &quot;MOZPL&quot;, &quot;Netscape&quot;,

     &quot;MPL&quot;, &quot;NPL&quot; or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your

     license (except to note that your license differs from this License)

     and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license

     contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and

     Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial

     Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in

     Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of

     this License.)



7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.



     COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,

     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,

     WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF

     DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.

     THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE

     IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,

     YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE

     COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER

     OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF

     ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.



8. TERMINATION.



     8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate

     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure

     such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All

     sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall

     survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their

     nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License

     shall survive.



     8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement

     claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer

     or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom

     You file such action is referred to as &quot;Participant&quot;)  alleging that:



     (a)  such Participant&#x27;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly

     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such

     Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License

     shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,

     unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)

     agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable

     royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such

     Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to

     the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days

     of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not

     mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim

     is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under

     Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of

     the 60 day notice period specified above.



     (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant&#x27;s

     Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then

     any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)

     and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,

     sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that

     Participant.



     8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant

     alleging that such Participant&#x27;s Contributor Version directly or

     indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as

     by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent

     infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses

     granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken

     into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or

     license.



     8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,

     all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)

     which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder

     prior to termination shall survive termination.



9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.



     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT

     (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL

     DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,

     OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR

     ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY

     CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,

     WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER

     COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN

     INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF

     LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY

     RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&#x27;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW

     PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE

     EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO

     THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.



10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.



     The Covered Code is a &quot;commercial item,&quot; as that term is defined in

     48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of &quot;commercial computer

     software&quot; and &quot;commercial computer software documentation,&quot; as such

     terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48

     C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),

     all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those

     rights set forth herein.



11. MISCELLANEOUS.



     This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject

     matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be

     unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent

     necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by

     California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if

     any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.

     With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,

     or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United

     States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be

     subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern

     District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,

     California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including

     without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys&#x27; fees and

     expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on

     Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.

     Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract

     shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this

     License.



12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.



     As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is

     responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,

     out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to

     work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such

     responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or

     shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.



13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.



     Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as

     &quot;Multiple-Licensed&quot;.  &quot;Multiple-Licensed&quot; means that the Initial

     Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under

     Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified

     by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

I think it would be awesome to use Json.NET in Mono for System.Web.Extensions.



The CC license has the following clause: Any of the above conditions can be waived if you get permission from the copyright holder.



I can waive that statement for you and Mono. Would that be acceptable?

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses



Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and

conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share

original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright

and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The

following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not

exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.



     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are

     intended for use by those authorized to give the public

     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by

     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are

     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms

     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.

     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before

     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the

     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any

     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-

     licensed material, or material used under an exception or

     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:

	wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors



     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public

     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the

     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If

     the licensor&#x27;s permission is not necessary for any reason--for

     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to

     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our

     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain

     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of

     the licensed material may still be restricted for other

     reasons, including because others have copyright or other

     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,

     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.

     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to

     respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations

     for the public:

to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons

Attribution 4.0 International Public License (&quot;Public License&quot;). To the

extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are

     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material

     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,

     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the

     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed

     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,

     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is

     synched in timed relation with a moving image.

     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in

     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.

     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or

     categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights

     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar

     Rights.



  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the

     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws

     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright

     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international

     agreements.



  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or

     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights

     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.



  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,

     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public

     License.



  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the

     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to

  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights

     under this Public License.



  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or

     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such

     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,

     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material

     available to the public including in ways that members of the

     public may access the material from a place and at a time

     individually chosen by them.



  j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright

     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of

     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially

     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.



  k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights

     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.





Section 2 -- Scope.



  a. License grant.



       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,

          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,

          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to

          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:



            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or

               in part; and



            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.



       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where

          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public

          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with

          its terms and conditions.



       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section

          6(a).



       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The

          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in

          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,

          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The

          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or

          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications

          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including

          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective

          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,

          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)

          (4) never produces Adapted Material.



       5. Downstream recipients.



            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every

               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically

               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the

               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this

               Public License.



            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose

               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or

               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the

               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the

               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed

               Material.



       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or

          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You

          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected

          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,

          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as

          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).



  b. Other rights.



       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not

          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,

          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to

          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to

          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited

          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed

          Rights, but not otherwise.



       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this

          Public License.



       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to

          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed

          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society

          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory

          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly

          reserves any right to collect such royalties.





Section 3 -- License Conditions.



Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the

following conditions.



  a. Attribution.



       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified

          form), You must:



            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor

               with the Licensed Material:



                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed

                    Material and any others designated to receive

                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by

                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if

                    designated);



                ii. a copyright notice;



               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;



                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of

                    warranties;



                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the

                    extent reasonably practicable;



            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and

               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and



            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this

               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or

               hyperlink to, this Public License.



       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any

          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in

          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be

          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or

          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required

          information.



       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the

          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent

          reasonably practicable.



       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter&#x27;s

          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted

          Material from complying with this Public License.





Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.



Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that

apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:



  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right

     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial

     portion of the contents of the database;



  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database

     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database

     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database

     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and



  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share

     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.



For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not

replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed

Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.





Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.



  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE

     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS

     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF

     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,

     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,

     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR

     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,

     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT

     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT

     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.



  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE

     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,

     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,

     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,

     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR

     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN

     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR

     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR

     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.



  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided

     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent

     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and

     waiver of all liability.





Section 6 -- Term and Termination.



  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and

     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with

     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License

     terminate automatically.



  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under

     Section 6(a), it reinstates:



       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided

          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the

          violation; or



       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.



     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any

     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations

     of this Public License.



  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the

     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop

     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so

     will not terminate this Public License.



  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public

     License.





Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.



  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different

     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.



  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the

     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and

     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.





Section 8 -- Interpretation.



  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and

     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose

     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully

     be made without permission under this Public License.



  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is

     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the

     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision

     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License

     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and

     conditions.



  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no

     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the

     Licensor.



  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted

     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities

     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal

     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

### GPL version 2



		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

		       Version 2, June 1991



 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies

 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.



			    Preamble



  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your

freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public

License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free

software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This

General Public License applies to most of the Free Software

Foundation&#x27;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to

using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by

the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to

your programs, too.



  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not

price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you

have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for

this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it

if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it

in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.



  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid

anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.

These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you

distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.



  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether

gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that

you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the

source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their

rights.



  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and

(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,

distribute and/or modify the software.



  Also, for each author&#x27;s protection and ours, we want to make certain

that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free

software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we

want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so

that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original

authors&#x27; reputations.



  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software

patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free

program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the

program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any

patent must be licensed for everyone&#x27;s free use or not licensed at all.



  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and

modification follow.



		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION



  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains

a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed

under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below,

refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;

means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:

that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,

either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another

language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in

the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.



Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not

covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of

running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program

is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the

Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).

Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.



  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#x27;s

source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you

conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate

copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the

notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;

and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License

along with the Program.



You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and

you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.



  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion

of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and

distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1

above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:



    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices

    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.



    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in

    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any

    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third

    parties under the terms of this License.



    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively

    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such

    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an

    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a

    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide

    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under

    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this

    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but

    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on

    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)



These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If

identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,

and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in

themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those

sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you

distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based

on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of

this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the

entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.



Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest

your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to

exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or

collective works based on the Program.



In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program

with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of

a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under

the scope of this License.



  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,

under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of

Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:



    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable

    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections

    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,



    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three

    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your

    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete

    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be

    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium

    customarily used for software interchange; or,



    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer

    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is

    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you

    received the program in object code or executable form with such

    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)



The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for

making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source

code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any

associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to

control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a

special exception, the source code distributed need not include

anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary

form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the

operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component

itself accompanies the executable.



If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering

access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent

access to copy the source code from the same place counts as

distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not

compelled to copy the source along with the object code.



  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program

except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt

otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is

void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under

this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such

parties remain in full compliance.



  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not

signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or

distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are

prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by

modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the

Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and

all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying

the Program or works based on it.



  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the

Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the

original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to

these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further

restrictions on the recipients&#x27; exercise of the rights granted herein.

You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to

this License.



  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent

infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),

conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or

otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not

excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot

distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this

License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you

may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent

license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by

all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then

the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to

refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.



If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under

any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to

apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other

circumstances.



It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any

patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any

such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the

integrity of the free software distribution system, which is

implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made

generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed

through that system in reliance on consistent application of that

system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing

to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot

impose that choice.



This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to

be a consequence of the rest of this License.



  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in

certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the

original copyright holder who places the Program under this License

may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding

those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among

countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates

the limitation as if written in the body of this License.



  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions

of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will

be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to

address new problems or concerns.



Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program

specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any

later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions

either of that version or of any later version published by the Free

Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of

this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software

Foundation.



  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free

programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author

to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free

Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes

make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals

of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and

of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.



			    NO WARRANTY



  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY

FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN

OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES

PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED

OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF

MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS

TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE

PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,

REPAIR OR CORRECTION.



  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING

WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR

REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,

INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING

OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED

TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY

YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER

PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE

POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.



		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS



	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs



  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest

possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it

free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.



  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest

to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively

convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least

the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.



    &lt;one line to give the program&#x27;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;

    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;



    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify

    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by

    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or

    (at your option) any later version.



    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,

    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the

    GNU General Public License for more details.



    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License

    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software

    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA





Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.



If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this

when it starts in an interactive mode:



    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author

    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w&#x27;.

    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it

    under certain conditions; type `show c&#x27; for details.



The hypothetical commands `show w&#x27; and `show c&#x27; should show the appropriate

parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may

be called something other than `show w&#x27; and `show c&#x27;; they could even be

mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.



You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your

school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if

necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:



  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program

  `Gnomovision&#x27; (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.



  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989

  Ty Coon, President of Vice



This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into

proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may

consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the

library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General

Public License instead of this License.

GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION



Version 3.1, 31 March 2009



Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc.



Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this

license document, but changing it is not allowed.



This GCC Runtime Library Exception (&quot;Exception&quot;) is an additional

permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version

3 (&quot;GPLv3&quot;). It applies to a given file (the &quot;Runtime Library&quot;) that

bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that

the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.



When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of

certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled

program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of

non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the

header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.



0. Definitions.



A file is an &quot;Independent Module&quot; if it either requires the Runtime

Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an

interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based

on the Runtime Library.



&quot;GCC&quot; means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without

modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of

the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any

subsequent versions published by the FSF.



&quot;GPL-compatible Software&quot; is software whose conditions of propagation,

modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with

the license of GCC.



&quot;Target Code&quot; refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual

target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for

input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution

phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any

format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used

for producing a compiler intermediate representation.



The &quot;Compilation Process&quot; transforms code entirely represented in

non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in

Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,

use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered

part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be

understood as starting with the output of the generators or

preprocessors.



A Compilation Process is &quot;Eligible&quot; if it is done using GCC, alone or

with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any

work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to

optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an

Eligible Compilation Process.



1. Grant of Additional Permission.



You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by

combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such

propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that

all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You

may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,

consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.



2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.



The availability of this Exception does not imply any general

presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft

requirements of the license of GCC.

    



Hopefully that text is self-explanatory. If it isn&#x27;t, you need to speak to your lawyer, or the Free Software Foundation.

   Version 1.01e, February 12th, 2005

   Copyright (C) 1998-2005 Gilles Vollant

   This code is a modified version of crypting code in Infozip distribution

   The encryption/decryption parts of this source code (as opposed to the
   non-echoing password parts) were originally written in Europe.  The
   whole source package can be freely distributed, including from the USA.
   (Prior to January 2000, re-export from the US was a violation of US law.)

   This encryption code is a direct transcription of the algorithm from
   Roger Schlafly, described by Phil Katz in the file appnote.txt.  This
   file (appnote.txt) is distributed with the PKZIP program (even in the
   version without encryption capabilities).

   If you don't need crypting in your application, just define symbols
   NOCRYPT and NOUNCRYPT.

   This code support the "Traditional PKWARE Encryption".

   The new AES encryption added on Zip format by Winzip (see the page
   http://www.winzip.com/aes_info.htm ) and PKWare PKZip 5.x Strong
   Encryption is not supported.

         Changes

    Oct-2009 - Defined ZPOS64_T to fpos_t on windows and u_int64_t on linux. (might need to find a better why for this)
    Oct-2009 - Change to fseeko64, ftello64 and fopen64 so large files would work on linux.
               More if/def section may be needed to support other platforms
    Oct-2009 - Defined fxxxx64 calls to normal fopen/ftell/fseek so they would compile on windows.
                          (but you should use iowin32.c for windows instead)
