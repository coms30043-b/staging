    <p>This website (and the game) does not collect any personal information.</p>
    <p>However, it is hosted by a third party (GitHub Inc.), using GitHub Pages, and therefore the GitHub privacy policy (available at <a>https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement</a>) applies.</p>
    <p>The game may allow you to connect to third-party servers - this is entirely at your own risk.</p>
